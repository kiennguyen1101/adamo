    <td><p align="justify"> From the man screen of the bulklister you either start a new session, open a previous saved session or import a comma separated listing into a new session.<br>
        Using the new session - When you select new session you are prompted to enter a name to describe the session if you are selling different types of item categories then this name could be something that reminds you of what type of items are in the listing, such as Computing, Electrical or Wholesale etc.<br>
        Naming a session something like its content will allow you to easily use the open previously saved session option to load a listing into the program for submitting to the auction or to allow you to update or add to the listing.<br>
        These listings contains in the session can also be 'Saved As' a different name later on if you change your mind, they can also be exported into a different format of CSV file so that you can if needed call the exported CSV file into a program you may use to keep track of your sales.<br>
        Exporting the current listing/session is a simple and easy to use way of saving only part or all of the information in your listings to a CSV file that can be called into such programs as Excel or other editing software.<br>
        From the export screen you will see the available records on the left hand side of the screen that you can select and transfer to the right hand side of the screen for exporting. You are not limited to exporting to a CSV file as you can set below the delimiter to use (for a CSV use a comma). Your custom editing program may require specific format for each record and these can be set prior to clicking Export. <br>
        Once you click export you can enter the name of the file to save the exported data as. </p></td>

Submit will submit the item in the listing you have highlighted and will only be enabled if you have selected an item, and then there the Submit all button that will submit all items in the listing that have not already been submitted. <br>
        You can tell by the legend at the bottom that items in pink are items that have not been submitted and items in yellow have previously been submitted in maybe a partially submission.<br>
        The reason for this is that you may not wish you submit all items at once or you may have cancelled a previous submission half way though the list etc.<br>
        Either way the entire listing can be marked as not submitted simply by clicking the button to the right of the find keyword box and has a red cross on it.<br>
        By the way the find keyword box is simply there to help you find a keyword in your listing if your listing grows to a long listing.<br>
        When you click the submit or submit all button you will be presented with the submit screen, this screen simply allows you to starting sending your items to the auction and listing them as live auctions. </p></td>

        Depending on which button you pressed in the listing screen the submission will start submitting the items or item to the auction site when you click submit and you will see the status of the submission for each item in the form of a progress bar that will display the upload progress and show the current item being submitted..<br>
        If you decide that you do not wish to submit the entire listing once you have already started then you can click the cancel button to end the submission.<br>
        On successful submission or partially submission once you close the submit screen you will see that the items that have been submitted to the auction have changed to a yellow color, you can as mention earlier return to that listing at another time and submit all and it will only submit the items still colored in pink, or you can reset them all again using the mark all as not submitted button.<br>
        <br>
        Once you have submitted partially or all of your items you can either use you browser to view the items you have submitted or go to the main screen by clicking the internet button and view them from the bulklister application. <br>
        <br>
        Depending on your auction site configuration you will either see your auctions live or be able to go to your account and make the auctions live. </p></td>
